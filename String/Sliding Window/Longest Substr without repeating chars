Problem: 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

Problem Statement: 

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

CODE:

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int first = 0, second = 0;
        vector<bool> chars(256, 0);
        int len = 0;
        while(second < s.size()) {
            //until that character is present inside our window, decrease the window.
            while(chars[s[second]]!=0) {
                chars[s[first]]=0;
                first++;
            }
            //increase the window size.
            chars[s[second]]=1;
            len = max(len, second-first+1);
            second++; 
        }
        return len;
    }
};
