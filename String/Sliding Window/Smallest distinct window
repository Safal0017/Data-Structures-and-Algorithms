Problem: Smallest distinct window
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-distant-window3132/1

Problem Statement:
Given a string str, your task is to find the length of the smallest window that contains all the characters of the given string at least once.

Example:

Input: str = "aabcbcdbca"
Output: 4
Explanation: Sub-String "dbca" has the smallest length that contains all the characters of str.
Input: str = "aaab"
Output: 2
Explanation: Sub-String "ab" has the smallest length that contains all the characters of str.
Input: str = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 7
Explanation: There are multiple substring with smallest length that contains all characters of str, "eksforg" and "ksforge". 
Constraints:
1 ≤ str.size() ≤ 105
str contains only lower-case english alphabets.

CODE:

class Solution {
  public:
    int findSubString(string& str) {
        // code here
        vector<int> alpha(256,0);
        int first = 0, second = 0, len = str.size(), diff = 0;
        
        //Calculate all the unique characters of the string
        while(first < str.size()) {
            
            if(alpha[str[first]]== 0)
            diff++;
            
            alpha[str[first]]++;
            first++;
            
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<256;i++) 
        alpha[i] = 0;
        
        first = 0;
        
        while(second< str.size()) {
            
            //if diff exists (diff > 0)
            while(diff && second<str.size()) {
                if(alpha[str[second]] == 0)
                diff--;
                
                alpha[str[second]]++;
                second++;
            }
            
            len = min(len, second-first);
            
            //if diff doesn't exist (diff == 0), logic until diff == 1
            while(diff!=1) {
                len = min(len, second-first);
                alpha[str[first]]--;
                
                if(alpha[str[first]]==0)
                diff++;
                
                first++;
            }
            
        }
        return len;
    }
};
