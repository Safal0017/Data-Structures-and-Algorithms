Link: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/profit-maximisation/

Problem Description
 
 

 Given an array A , representing seats in each row of a stadium. You need to sell tickets to B people.

Each seat costs equal to the number of vacant seats in the row it belongs to. The task is to maximize the profit by selling the tickets to B people.


Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000

1 <= B <= 1000000

Input Format
First argument is the array A.

Second argument is integer B.

Output Format
Return one integer, the answer to the problem.

Example Input
Input 1:

A = [2, 3]
B = 3
Input 2:

A = [1, 4]
B = 2


Example Output
Output 1:

7
Output 2:

7


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 First you serve the seat with number = 3. Then with 2 and then with 2. hence answer = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.
Explanation 2:

 You give both tickets from the row with 4 seats. 4 + 3 = 7.

CODE:

int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A, int B) {
    
    //Since Insertion & Deletion are happening together
    //will make use of heap.
    
    priority_queue<int> p;
    
    for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++) 
    p.push(A[i]);
    
    int profit = 0;
    
    while(B && !p.empty()) {
        
        int val = p.top();
        p.pop();
        profit+=val;
        
        if(val-1)
        p.push(val-1);
        
        B--;
    }
    
    return profit;
    
}
